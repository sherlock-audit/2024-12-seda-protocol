SEDA chain core contract written in CosmWasm.

To learn how to build a local version, please read [developing](DEVELOPING.md).
To learn how to contribute, please read [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The core contract enables some of the core features of the SEDA protocol. It allows:
- Users to post data requests.
- Users can also stake to become executors allowing them to commit & reveal on data requests.
- The chain, via sudo functions, to timeout & remove data requests, while rewarding/burning funds for the later.
- Owner to transfer ownership, change configurations, and management of the allowlist.

## Dependencies

Before starting, make sure you have [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) along with a recent `rustc` and `cargo` version installed. Currently, we are testing on 1.70.0+. You need to have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed as well.

You can check that via:

```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup target list --installed
# if wasm32 is not listed above, run this
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Install [wasm-opt][https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen]: `cargo install wasm-opt --locked`, this produces a optimized version of the contract small enough to be uploaded to the chain.
