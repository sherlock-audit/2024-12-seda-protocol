[SEDA](https://seda.xyz) is an open-source data transmission and computation network that enables a permissionless environment for developers to deploy data feeds. It is built on top of [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd).

To learn about SEDA protocol, please visit [docs.seda.xyz](https://docs.seda.xyz).<br>
To learn how to build a local version, please read [developing](DEVELOPING.md).<br>
To learn how to contribute, please read [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

### System Requirements

The current minimal system requirements are as follows and may be subject to change based on future improvements:

 - Quad Core or larger AMD or Intel (amd64) CPU
   - ARM CPUs (e.g., Apple M1) are discouraged at this time
 - 32GB RAM (with ample swap space)
 - 1TB SSD Storage
 - 100MBPS bidirectional internet connection

Running SEDA on lower-spec hardware is feasible, but you may encounter potential performance issues or an increased risk of crashes.

### Download From Releases
